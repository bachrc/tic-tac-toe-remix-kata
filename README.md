# TicTacToe Kata (calisthenics remix)

This repository contains my implementations of a kata given in the meet-up 
"Crafter En Herbe (Septembre 2020)" - https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Crafters-en-herbe/events/273245848/

I did implement it in Rust, in TDD.

## The concept

We chose the TicTacToe kata, and decided to implement some of the calisthenics rules on the kata.

If you want to know more about the calisthenics objects, I recommend you [this article](https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/).

And between those rules, we decided to only pick a few :

- Only one level of indentation per method
- Don't use the ELSE keyword
- Don't abbreviate
- No classes with more than two instance variables
- No getters/setters

## The reality of the implementation

My implementation isn't 100% com√πpliants with the rules concerning the "No getter/setter" rule. If you have an idea on how to be compliant : 
don't hesitate to do a pull request ! :)
